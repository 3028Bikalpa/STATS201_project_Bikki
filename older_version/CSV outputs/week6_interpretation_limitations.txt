WEEK 6 INTERPRETATION SUMMARY\nSelected model: Gradient Boosting | Feature set: Engineered\nOut-of-sample fit (Test R2): 0.9436\nGeneralization gap (Train-Test R2): 0.0432\nMargin over runner-up Test R2: 0.0055\nTop explanatory signals (from feature importance): Disease_Burden, under-five deaths, Adult Mortality, Schooling, Income composition of resources\nTemporal robustness spread in Test R2: 0.0227\nLearning curve endpoint Test R2 (100% train fraction): 0.9437\n\nWEEK 6 LIMITATIONS AND SCOPE\n- Scope: supervised regression on the current cleaned lag-free dataset and temporal split (train <= 2013, test >= 2014).\n- External validity is limited to populations and years represented in this dataset.\n- Results are associational, not causal; coefficients/importances indicate predictive utility only.\n- Potential residual confounding from unobserved policy, healthcare system, or reporting differences.\n- Model diagnostics and robustness checks reduce but do not eliminate misspecification risk.
