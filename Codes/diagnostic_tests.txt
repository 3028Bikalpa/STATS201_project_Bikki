RESIDUAL DIAGNOSTIC TESTS
Shapiro-Wilk: stat=0.9812, p=0.0001045 => Not normal
Breusch-Pagan: stat=34.6368, p=0.1807 => Homoscedastic
Durbin-Watson: 1.4425 (2.0 ~ no autocorrelation)

INTERPRETATION
- Residuals approximately normal? Not normal. If not normal, inference on errors may be less reliable.
- Variance constant (homoscedastic)? Homoscedastic. If heteroscedastic, prediction intervals may be biased.
- Influential outliers detected (Cook's D > 0.5): None
- Diagnostics suggest assumptions are met if normality and homoscedasticity hold, and no strong influential points exist.
