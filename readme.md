# Animal Classification Using Machine Learning

## Research Question
Can machine learning models accurately classify animals based on image data?

## Project Description
In this project, we use machine learning for the classification of animals based on images. We train several models using pictures of four animals and evaluate which model predicts the animal with the least error.

This project is approached as an image classification task. Images of four animals are used as input to train the model. Currently, there are 1,000 pictures for each animal, but the dataset might be increased by mirroring the images or zooming in. I may try to apply these techniques, but I am not sure if I will be able to do so.

This project demonstrates how visual data can be used as input for machine learning models to distinguish between different animal species.

## Unit of Analysis
The unit of analysis for this project is a single animal image.

## Data Source
This project uses a publicly available dataset from Kaggle, which can be accessed using the link below:

The data was downloaded and saved in the working directory for this project and then loaded into the notebook file.

As mentioned earlier, I might try mirroring, zooming in, or making other adjustments to generate more data from the existing images. This will depend on my skills and time commitment, as I am still learning how to apply these techniques.

## Feasibility Assessment
The number of pictures should not be a problem for this project. If needed, additional image datasets can be obtained from the internet.

Some challenges may include differences in image quality and lighting, which could affect the model’s performance.

Overall, this project is feasible and suitable for applying supervised machine learning techniques to image data.
