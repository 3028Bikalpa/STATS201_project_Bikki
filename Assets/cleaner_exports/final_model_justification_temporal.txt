FINAL MODEL JUSTIFICATION (TEMPORAL)
Best model: Random Forest (n_estimators=300, max_depth=15) | feature set: log_enhanced
Best Test_R2: 0.988479
Best Test_RMSE: 0.754141
Best R2_Gap: 0.011215
Runner-up marginal Test_R2 gain: 2.563220073847905e-05
Min temporal sensitivity Test_R2: 0.9884487426801921
Criteria: marginal_gain<0.005, R2_Gap<=0.03, min_temporal_R2>=0.9
Decision: STOP and freeze final model
Reason: stop when additional complexity no longer yields meaningful future-year gain with acceptable generalization and robustness.
